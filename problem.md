I dropped a neural net
Oh no! I dropped an extremely valuable trading model and it fell apart into linear layers! I need to rebuild it before anyone notices, but I can't remember how these pieces go together, or how it was trained.

All I have left are the pieces of the model and some historical data. Can you help me figure out how to put it back together?

Luckily I still have the source code of the layers that the neural network is made of. They look like this:

class Block(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_dim: int, hidden_dim: int):
        super().__init__()
        self.inp = nn.Linear(in_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.activation = nn.ReLU()
        self.out = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, in_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        residual = x
        x = self.inp(x)
        x = self.activation(x)
        x = self.out(x)
        return residual + x

class LastLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_dim: int, out_dim: int):
        super().__init__()
        self.layer = nn.Linear(in_dim, out_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.layer(x)
The solution to this puzzle is a permutation. For each index from 0 to 96 (inclusive), give the index of the piece that is applied in that position.
Your solution must be comma seperated indices, like 0,1,2,3,...,96

You have access to a laptop 4050 gpu as your resources.

The data in the csv consists of 48 features, the output of the correct model, and the true value. The pieces folder has the weights of the 97 linear layer weights, that join as pairs for the residual blocks.
